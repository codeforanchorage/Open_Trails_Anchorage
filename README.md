=====================

Convert the GIS files for trails around anchorage into geojson

The files for this project are publicly available at the municipality of Anchorage and Alaska Department of Natural Resources websites at 

    1. http://www.muni.org/Departments/it/GIS2/Pages/MOAGISData.aspx (Shapefile)
    2. http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/aktrails/explore/astgglearthmap.htm (KMZ) 

We are adopting the geojson open format for this project in order to complete the open trails system specification (http://www.codeforamerica.org/specifications/trails/spec.html).
